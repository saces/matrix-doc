      summary: Compare auth chains with the receiving server
      description: |-
        Compares the auth chain provided with what the receiving server has for the
        room ID and event ID combination.

        The auth difference can be calculated in two parts, where the "remote auth"
        is the auth chain provided by the sending server and the "local auth" is the
        auth chain the receiving server has. With those lists, the algorithm works
        bottom-up after sorting each chain by depth then by event ID. The differences
        are then discovered and returned as the response to this API call.
